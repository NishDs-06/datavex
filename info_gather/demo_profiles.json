Yes, Notion offers project templates for various industries, from software and marketing to construction and education. Each template can be customized to fit industry-specific workflows while maintaining core project management principles. Do Notion project management tools allow custom workflow creation? Yes. Notion's composable approach lets you create custom workflows tailored to your team's needs, combining different views and properties that can evolve as your projects change. What does \"composable project management\" mean? It's the idea of building your system from modular parts that can be reconfigured as needs change. Your project management tool, built by you, for you. Is Notion good for project management? Yes. Teams use Notion to manage plans, tasks, timelines, docs, and status updates in one place. Because templates are composable, you can tailor workflows (Agile, Waterfall, hybrid) without duct\u2011taping multiple tools together. Competitors offer templates too, but Notion's linked databases keep everything connected. What project management templates should I start with? Start with a project plan, timeline (Gantt), WBS, RACI, and a weekly status report. These together cover the four fundamentals of any project: scope, schedule, ownership, and communication. Can I manage Agile projects in Notion? Yes. Use a backlog and sprint board (Kanban), plus a timeline for capacity planning. Add retrospectives and a change log to complete the loop. How do Notion templates compare to spreadsheets or docs? Templates in spreadsheets are quick, but they're usually static. Notion templates create databases you can relate, filter, and visualize (board, timeline, calendar), with the flexibility to adapt as projects grow. Notion lets you bring docs, tasks, and wiki together in one space. No more SaaS sprawl!",

Our story Early computing pioneers envisioned a future where machines on our desks could amplify our imagination, extend our intellect, and help us model information in ways never before seen. This is the type of tool we want to build together at Notion \u2014 one that gives you the software you can mold and shape like clay to solve your problems your way. We\u2019ve heard Notion described many ways. It can be as simple as a blank piece of paper, making writing feel light and delightful. It can be as complex as a relational database that stores huge amounts of data. We sometimes compare it to a set of Legos (if Legos were designed by The New York Times). But at its core, Notion is a toolbox of software building blocks that let you manage your life and work however you find most useful. To make this possible, we\u2019ve brought together a diverse team of individuals passionate about computing, history, art, alternative programming languages, music, skateboarding, and craft.

View all openings View all openings What we're all about We're making it easier for engineers to build custom, internal software. Software has transformed industries, but it's currently too expensive to plan, build, and maintain. And that's a shame, because it's so useful! Our goal is to make this large class of software faster, cheaper, and more enjoyable to build. Candidate Experience Recruiting processes can feel impersonal and one-sided. We'd like to get to know you, and for you to get to know us. Here's what you can expect from a typical interview loop, though some roles may have more or fewer interviews. 1. Intro call An introductory call with a recruiter or hiring manager to learn more about what you're looking for, the role, and whether it's a good fit. This is a great step to ask any questions you may have about the team or the company! 2. Take-home exercise or follow-up call This intermediate step helps us get to know more about you and closely reflects what you would be doing day-to-day in the role. This interview will be catered to the respective job in order to assess the specific skill sets for that role. 3. Onsite interview A round of 3-5 \u201consite\u201d interviews with the team you would potentially be joining and a cross-functional partner or two. We'll make sure you have a clear understanding of what to expect during the onsite interviews so that you are fully prepared for this final step. Set up to help you succeed Though 80% of us joined remotely during the pandemic, we really like spending time with each other in person and believe in the power of in-person collaboration, creativity, and connection. We have returned in a hybrid capacity to our San Francisco , New York , and London offices. Benefits and perks We're investing in you. Your health Our healthcare plans include flexible, competitive options for medical, vision, dental, life insurance, and disability benefits. Your fuel Fully snack-stocked kitchens at every turn, with breakfast, lunch and dinner provided at our San Francisco and New York offices. Your growth We provide a $1,200 annual stipend that can be utilized for all learning-related expenses, including books, conferences, classes, and more. Your family Access to comprehensive family planning services, generous paid parental leave for new parents, and a remarkable $10,000 lifetime benefit towards fertility support. Your time Flexible freedom for a healthier you: take the time off that you need, when you need it! Discover flexible PTO and our 4 week Work From Anywhere policy to rejuvenate on your time. Your sidekick Bring your favorite sidekick to work and enjoy our dog-friendly offices! Your future Plan for your future. We offer enrollment and matching up to 4% for our US-based employees. Your wellbeing Enjoy a suite of perks and memberships that enable you to thrive both personally and professionally. Open Careers at Retool 0 roles across all locations and departments",

View all openings View all openings What we're all about We're making it easier for engineers to build custom, internal software. Software has transformed industries, but it's currently too expensive to plan, build, and maintain. And that's a shame, because it's so useful! Our goal is to make this large class of software faster, cheaper, and more enjoyable to build. Candidate Experience Recruiting processes can feel impersonal and one-sided. We'd like to get to know you, and for you to get to know us. Here's what you can expect from a typical interview loop, though some roles may have more or fewer interviews. 1. Intro call An introductory call with a recruiter or hiring manager to learn more about what you're looking for, the role, and whether it's a good fit. This is a great step to ask any questions you may have about the team or the company! 2. Take-home exercise or follow-up call This intermediate step helps us get to know more about you and closely reflects what you would be doing day-to-day in the role. This interview will be catered to the respective job in order to assess the specific skill sets for that role. 3. Onsite interview A round of 3-5 \u201consite\u201d interviews with the team you would potentially be joining and a cross-functional partner or two. We'll make sure you have a clear understanding of what to expect during the onsite interviews so that you are fully prepared for this final step. Set up to help you succeed Though 80% of us joined remotely during the pandemic, we really like spending time with each other in person and believe in the power of in-person collaboration, creativity, and connection. We have returned in a hybrid capacity to our San Francisco , New York , and London offices. Benefits and perks We're investing in you. Your health Our healthcare plans include flexible, competitive options for medical, vision, dental, life insurance, and disability benefits. Your fuel Fully snack-stocked kitchens at every turn, with breakfast, lunch and dinner provided at our San Francisco and New York offices. Your growth We provide a $1,200 annual stipend that can be utilized for all learning-related expenses, including books, conferences, classes, and more. Your family Access to comprehensive family planning services, generous paid parental leave for new parents, and a remarkable $10,000 lifetime benefit towards fertility support. Your time Flexible freedom for a healthier you: take the time off that you need, when you need it! Discover flexible PTO and our 4 week Work From Anywhere policy to rejuvenate on your time.
